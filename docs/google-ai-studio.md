# üÜì Google AI Studio Guide

Google AI Studio provides access to AGOR with Pro models - no subscription required! This guide will get you set up and running smoothly.

## üéØ Why Google AI Studio?

- **‚úÖ No subscription required** - Access to powerful models like Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **‚úÖ Function Calling support** (essential for AGOR)
- **‚úÖ File upload capability** for bundles
- **‚úÖ No usage limits** for basic use

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Your Bundle

```bash
# Install AGOR locally
pipx install agor

# Bundle your project (use .zip format for Google AI Studio)
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -f zip

# This creates: your-project-agor-bundle.zip
```

### Step 2: Google AI Studio Setup

1. **Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Create a new chat**
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Enable Function Calling**
   - Look for "Function Calling" toggle in the model settings
   - **This must be enabled** for AGOR to work properly
   - Without this, the AI will simulate commands instead of executing them

### Step 3: Upload and Initialize

1. **Upload your .zip bundle** using the file attachment button
2. **Copy and paste the generated prompt** (AGOR creates this automatically)
3. **Select your role** when prompted:
   - **SOLO DEVELOPER** - Deep codebase analysis and implementation _(Single Agent)_
   - **PROJECT COORDINATOR** - Strategic planning and team coordination _(Multi-Agent)_
   - **AGENT WORKER** - Task execution and processing work snapshots _(Multi-Agent)_

## üîß Critical Configuration

### Function Calling Must Be Enabled

Google AI Studio has a **Function Calling** toggle that **must be enabled** for AGOR to work. Here's why:

- **With Function Calling**: AI executes real git commands using the portable binary
- **Without Function Calling**: AI simulates commands and can't access your actual code

**If you see simulation behavior:**

```
# Simulating: git ls-files
# Simulating: git status
```

**Remind the AI:**

> "You have a real, functional git binary at `/tmp/agor_tools/git`. Please make it executable with `chmod 755 /tmp/agor_tools/git` and use it directly. Do not simulate commands - execute them for real."

## üéº Role Selection Guide

When AGOR initializes, it will ask you to choose a role. Here's how to decide:

### üìã PROJECT COORDINATOR

**Choose this when:**

- Planning a new feature or project
- Coordinating multiple development tasks
- Designing team workflows
- Breaking down complex requirements

**You'll get:**

- Strategic planning tools
- Team coordination hotkeys
- Multi-agent strategy selection
- Workflow design capabilities

### üîç SOLO DEVELOPER

**Choose this when:**

- Analyzing existing code
- Implementing specific features
- Debugging issues
- Working solo on technical tasks

**You'll get:**

- Comprehensive codebase analysis
- Code exploration tools
- Implementation-focused hotkeys
- Technical deep-dive capabilities

### ü§ñ AGENT WORKER

**Choose this when:**

- Following instructions from a coordinator
- Executing specific assigned tasks
- Working as part of a larger team
- Implementing predefined requirements

**You'll get:**

- Task execution tools
- Coordination communication
- Snapshot procedures
- Status reporting capabilities

## üí° Workflow Tips & Troubleshooting Reminders

Remember that the AI may need explicit instructions, especially regarding the execution of tools like Git. Refer to the main "Troubleshooting" section for detailed solutions. The `meta` hotkey is always available for providing feedback on AGOR itself.

## üîÑ Multi-Agent Coordination

Google AI Studio works great for **single-agent workflows**, but you can also coordinate **multiple AI instances**:

1. **Coordinator Instance**: Use PROJECT COORDINATOR role for planning
2. **Worker Instances**: Use AGENT WORKER role for implementation
3. **Share coordination files** (`.agor/agentconvo.md`) between instances
4. **Use snapshot prompts** generated by the coordinator (using the `hp` hotkey).

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI simulates commands or reports functions unavailable**

- ‚úÖ **Ensure Function Calling is enabled in model settings.** This is the most common cause. Look for a "Function Calling" or "Tools" toggle in the Google AI Studio model settings. Without this, the AI cannot execute actual commands or use provided tools.

**Git commands being simulated**

- ‚úÖ Remind AI about the real git binary: "You have a real, functional git binary at `/tmp/agor_tools/git`. Please make it executable with `chmod 755 /tmp/agor_tools/git` and use it directly for all Git operations (e.g., `/tmp/agor_tools/git status`). Do not simulate commands."

**Git commands fail (e.g., permission denied or command not found initially)**

- ‚úÖ Remind the AI to make the bundled Git binary executable: `chmod 755 /tmp/agor_tools/git`. It should then use the full path: `/tmp/agor_tools/git <command>`.
- ‚úÖ If the AI reports `git: command not found`, explicitly tell it: "The git binary is located at `/tmp/agor_tools/git`. You must use this full path to execute git commands, for example: `/tmp/agor_tools/git --version`."

**AI cannot find the Git repository**

- ‚úÖ Instruct the AI to search its environment recursively for the `.git` directory (e.g., `find /tmp -name .git -type d`) and then navigate to the project's root directory (the parent directory of the `.git` folder).

**Bundle extraction fails**

- ‚úÖ Use `.zip` format (not `.tar.gz`) for Google AI Studio.
- ‚úÖ Re-upload if extraction seems incomplete or if the AI cannot find expected files in `/tmp/PROJECT_NAME_agor_bundle/`.

**Role selection not working**

- ‚úÖ Re-paste the initialization prompt that AGOR provided when you created the bundle.
- ‚úÖ Ensure the bundle was properly extracted and the AI can see the `README_ai.md` file within the bundle.
