# üì∏ Agent Snapshot System

One of AGOR's most powerful features is seamless agent transitions using snapshots. Whether you're switching roles, passing work to a specialist, or need to step away mid-task, AGOR's snapshot system ensures no context is lost.

## üí° Snapshots for Everyone (Including Solo Developers!)

While the concept of a "snapshot" can imply passing work between different agents or team members, AGOR's snapshot system is a powerful tool even for **solo developers**. Think of it as creating a comprehensive "snapshot" of your current work:

*   **Context Preservation Across Sessions**: If you're stepping away from a task and want to ensure you can pick it up seamlessly later (perhaps hours, days, or even weeks later), creating a snapshot for your "future self" captures all relevant code changes, analysis, decisions, and next steps.
*   **Managing AI Context Limits**: Large language models have context windows. If a task is complex and requires more back-and-forth than a single session can hold, creating a snapshot allows you to effectively "reset" the context for the AI while providing it with a structured, detailed summary of everything it needs to continue. You can then start a new conversation with the AI, provide the snapshot document, and carry on.
*   **Switching Tools or Models**: If you start a task with one AI model and wish to continue with another, a snapshot document provides a standardized way to transfer the complete state of your work.
*   **Structured Self-Correction**: If you've gone down a path and need to backtrack or rethink, creating a snapshot of your current state can be a useful way to document what you've done before exploring a new direction.

So, as you read about the snapshot system, remember that while many examples involve multiple agents, the underlying mechanisms and benefits offer significant advantages for managing and preserving context in solo development workflows as well.

## üéØ Why Snapshots Matter

In traditional development, context switching is expensive. When one developer passes work to another, critical information gets lost:

- **Why** certain decisions were made
- **What** approaches were tried and failed
- **Where** the current implementation stands
- **How** to continue the work effectively

AGOR's snapshot system solves this by capturing **complete context** in a structured, actionable format.

## üîÑ Snapshot Scenarios

### 1. Role Switching

```
PROJECT COORDINATOR ‚Üí SOLO DEVELOPER
"I've planned the architecture, now I need someone to implement it"
```

### 2. Specialization Transition

```
SOLO DEVELOPER ‚Üí AGENT WORKER (Security Specialist)
"I've built the feature, now I need security review and hardening"
```

### 3. Cross-Session Work (Self-Snapshot for Continuity)

```
AGENT WORKER ‚Üí AGENT WORKER (Different Shift)
"I'm ending my work session, here's where I left off"
```
This is ideal for solo developers or any agent needing to pause work and resume later with full context, effectively creating a detailed bookmark of their progress.

### 4. Managing AI Context Windows

When a conversation with an AI model approaches its context limit, creating a snapshot allows you to summarize the work done and provide a clean, structured starting point for a new conversation or session. This ensures the AI has all necessary information without being burdened by a long, truncated history.

### 5. Switching Tools or AI Models

If you start a task with one Large Language Model (LLM) or AI assistant and wish to continue or get a second opinion from another, a snapshot document provides a standardized, portable format to transfer the complete state of your work, including code, analysis, and current objectives.

### 6. Escalation Snapshots

```
AGENT WORKER ‚Üí PROJECT COORDINATOR
"I've hit a blocker that needs architectural decision"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Creating a Snapshot

**Step 1: Use the `snapshot` hotkey**

```
snapshot
```

**Step 2: AGOR prompts for context**

- What problem are you solving?
- What work have you completed?
- What commits have you made?
- Which files have you modified?
- What's the current status?
- What are the next steps?
- Any important context or gotchas?

**Step 3: AGOR generates comprehensive documentation**

- Creates snapshot document in `.agor/snapshots/`
- Updates coordination logs
- Generates snapshot prompt for receiving agent

### Receiving a Snapshot

**Step 1: Use the `load_snapshot` hotkey**

```
load_snapshot
```

**Step 2: Review snapshot document**

- Read problem definition and context
- Understand work completed so far
- Review commits and file changes
- Verify current repository state

**Step 3: Confirm understanding and continue**

- Update `.agor/agentconvo.md` with receipt confirmation
- Begin work on next steps
- Maintain documentation standards

## üìã Snapshot Document Structure

Every snapshot document includes:

### üéØ Problem Definition

## üí° Best Practices

### For Snapshot Creators

**Be Comprehensive**

- Include everything the next agent needs to know
- Don't assume they have your context
- Document your reasoning, not just your actions

**Be Specific**

- Include exact commit hashes
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers
- Give concrete next steps, not vague suggestions

**Be Honest**

- Document what didn't work
- Explain workarounds and technical debt
- Highlight areas of uncertainty

### For Snapshot Recipients

**Verify Everything**

- Check that repository state matches snapshot
- Verify you're on the correct git branch and commit
- Confirm AGOR version compatibility
- Confirm all described changes are present
- Test that current implementation works as described

**Ask Questions**

- If anything is unclear, ask for clarification
- Don't assume you understand complex decisions
- Verify your interpretation before proceeding

**Maintain Standards**

- Update snapshot document with your progress
- Follow the same documentation quality
- Create your own snapshot when passing work forward

## üîç AGOR Version Compatibility

Each snapshot document includes the AGOR version used to create it. This is critical for maintaining protocol compatibility:

### Why Version Matters

- **Protocol Evolution**: AGOR coordination protocols evolve over time
- **Hotkey Changes**: New hotkeys and commands are added in different versions
- **Template Updates**: Snapshot templates and procedures may change
- **Feature Compatibility**: New features may not be available in older versions

### Version Verification

When receiving a snapshot:

```bash
# Check your current AGOR version
agor --version

# If versions don't match, consider checking out the snapshot version
git checkout v0.2.0  # Example: checkout the version used in snapshot

# Or update to latest if snapshot is from newer version
pipx upgrade agor
```

### Version Compatibility Guidelines

**Same Major.Minor Version**: ‚úÖ Fully compatible

- Example: 0.2.0 ‚ÜîÔ∏è 0.2.1
- All protocols and hotkeys should work identically

**Different Minor Version**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mostly compatible

- Example: 0.2.x ‚ÜîÔ∏è 0.3.x
- Core protocols compatible, some new features may be missing

**Different Major Version**: ‚ùå May have breaking changes

- Example: 0.x.x ‚ÜîÔ∏è 1.x.x
- Significant protocol changes possible, review carefully

### Handling Version Mismatches

**If you have older AGOR version:**

```bash
# Option 1: Upgrade to match or exceed snapshot version
pipx upgrade agor

# Option 2: Use git to checkout snapshot version
git checkout v0.2.0  # Use version from snapshot
```

**If you have newer AGOR version:**

- Usually safe to proceed with newer version
- New features will be available
- Core protocols should remain compatible

**If major version difference:**

- Review snapshot document carefully
- Check for protocol changes in release notes
- Consider using exact version match for critical snapshots

## üîß Advanced Snapshot Patterns

### Multi-Agent Snapshots

When work needs to go to multiple agents:

```
COORDINATOR creates snapshot for parallel work:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent A: Frontend implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent B: Backend API
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent C: Database schema
```

### Iterative Snapshots

For complex features requiring multiple passes:

```
Round 1: ANALYST ‚Üí Basic implementation (creates snapshot)
Round 2: SECURITY AGENT ‚Üí Security hardening (receives snapshot, creates new one)
Round 3: PERFORMANCE AGENT ‚Üí Optimization (and so on)
Round 4: INTEGRATION AGENT ‚Üí System integration
```

### Emergency Snapshots

When urgent issues arise:

```
CURRENT AGENT creates emergency snapshot:
- Immediate problem description
- Current debugging state
- Attempted solutions
- Escalation path
```

## üìä Snapshot Quality Metrics

### Good Snapshots Include:

- ‚úÖ Clear problem definition
- ‚úÖ Complete work inventory
- ‚úÖ Specific git commits
- ‚úÖ Detailed next steps
- ‚úÖ Technical context and decisions
- ‚úÖ Testing and verification steps

### Poor Snapshots Lack:

- ‚ùå Vague problem description
- ‚ùå Incomplete work summary
- ‚ùå Missing commit information
- ‚ùå Unclear next steps
- ‚ùå No technical context
- ‚ùå No verification procedures

## üéØ Integration with AGOR Strategies

Snapshots work seamlessly with all AGOR strategies:

**Parallel Divergent**: Snapshots for capturing independent work before synthesis.
**Pipeline**: Structured snapshots between pipeline stages.
**Swarm**: Snapshots for tasks as agents complete them.
**Red Team**: Snapshots for capturing build/break phase states.
**Mob Programming**: Snapshots for capturing session state during role rotations.

## üîÑ Snapshot Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Agent creates comprehensive snapshot document using the `snapshot` hotkey.
2. **Notification**: Receiving agent is notified (if applicable) via coordination channels.
3. **Review**: Receiving agent reviews and verifies snapshot.
4. **Confirmation**: Receipt is confirmed in coordination logs (if applicable).
5. **Continuation**: Work continues seamlessly from the snapshot point.
6. **Archival**: Snapshots serve as a record of work at a specific point in time.
