## üéØ What Makes AGOR Special?

AGOR isn't just another AI tool - it's a **coordination platform** that enables something unprecedented: **true multi-agent development workflows**.

Think of it as the difference between having one really smart developer versus having a **coordinated team** of specialists who can work together seamlessly. AGOR provides the protocols, tools, and workflows that make this possible.

### Understanding AGOR's Interactions

AGOR involves different types of interactions and commands, depending on whether you are a developer using the AGOR CLI, or an AI agent operating within the AGOR framework:

1.  **Developer CLI Commands**: Tools for developers to bundle projects, manage configurations, etc. (e.g., `agor bundle`).
2.  **AI Conversational Hotkeys**: Interactive commands (e.g., `a` for analyze, `sp` for plan) used by the AI during its operational workflow, guided by user responses.
3.  **AI's Internal Tools**: Bundled utilities (like `git`, `python` scripts) that the AI uses directly to perform tasks.

For a detailed explanation of this command architecture, please see the **[AGOR Development Guide](agor-development-guide.md#agor-architecture-understanding)**.
