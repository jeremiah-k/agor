# üìñ AGOR Usage Guide - Comprehensive Overview

**Complete guide to understanding and using AgentOrchestrator effectively**

## üöÄ Installation & Platform Setup

This section provides detailed setup instructions for initializing AGOR agents on different platforms. Choose the platform that matches your environment.

<details>
<summary><b>AugmentCode Local Agent</b></summary>

### AugmentCode Local Agent

**For the flagship AugmentCode Local Agent (VS Code extension) running locally:**

#### Prerequisites:

- VS Code with AugmentCode extension installed
- Git access for cloning repositories
- Basic familiarity with VS Code workspace management

#### Setup Steps:

**Step 1: Clone AGOR Repository**
Clone the AGOR repository to your local machine, for example:
`git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git ~/agor`

**Step 2: Add AGOR as Workspace Context**

- Open VS Code with Augment extension installed
- Click the folder icon in the Augment sidebar panel
- Click **+ Add more...** at the bottom of Source Folders
- Select the `~/agor` directory and click **Add Source Folder**

_This gives the agent direct access to all AGOR documentation and tools_

**Step 3: Configure User Guidelines**

- In Augment Chat, click the **Context menu** or use **@-mention**
- Select **User Guidelines**
- Copy and paste the complete User Guidelines from: [augment_user_guidelines.md](augment_user_guidelines.md)

_This ensures the agent follows AGOR protocols and creates mandatory snapshots_

**Step 4: Preparing the Agent**
To ensure your AI agent understands how to work with AGOR, you will provide it with an initialization prompt (see next step). This prompt will instruct the agent to read specific AGOR protocol files from the cloned repository. This is how the agent learns its capabilities and how to coordinate.

**Step 5: Agent Initialization Prompt**

**Provide the following prompt to your AI agent (e.g., in AugmentCode chat):**

```
I'm working with the AGOR (AgentOrchestrator) framework for multi-agent development coordination.

Please read these key files from the workspace sources to understand the system:
- src/agor/tools/README_ai.md (role selection and initialization)
- src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md (comprehensive operational guide)
- src/agor/tools/agent-start-here.md (quick startup guide)
- src/agor/tools/index.md (documentation index for efficient lookup)

After reading these files, help me initialize AGOR for this project and select the appropriate role (Worker Agent or Project Coordinator) based on the task requirements.

# <--- Add your detailed step-by-step instructions below --->
```

**Step 6: Local Environment Setup (Optional - For Using AGOR's Python Tools Directly)**
If you (the user) want to run AGOR's bundled Python development tools directly on your machine (e.g., for testing or advanced scripting), you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Navigate to your cloned AGOR directory
cd ~/agor

# Create a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS and Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Git Bash or WSL):
# source .venv/Scripts/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
# .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install AGOR's agent development dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r src/agor/tools/agent-requirements.txt

# Test that the tools are accessible (optional)
# This command attempts to import and test all tools.
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src'); from agor.tools.dev_tools import test_all_tools; test_all_tools(); print('AGOR development tools are ready!')"

# To deactivate the virtual environment when done:
# deactivate
```

**Note**: This local Python environment setup is for users who want to directly execute AGOR's Python scripts. Your AI agent, especially in AugmentCode, typically interacts with these tools through its own means after reading the protocol files.

**Workflow:**

1. Agent reads AGOR protocol from your local Sources
2. Agent selects appropriate role for the task
3. Agent works within your local VS Code environment
4. Full codebase context and completions available
5. Manual git operations (agent provides code, you commit)

python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from agor.tools.dev_tools import test_all_tools, get_current_timestamp_formatted, get_available_functions_reference

# Verify tooling works
test_all_tools()
print(f'Session started at: {get_current_timestamp_formatted()}')

# Show all available functions for agent reference
print('\nüìã Available AGOR Functions:')
print(get_available_functions_reference())
"

# Review agent startup guide
cat src/agor/tools/agent-start-here.md

# Now return to your project's directory with AGOR initialized

## üéØ Understanding AGOR's Dual Nature

### From AgentGrunt to AgentOrchestrator

AGOR is a fork of the innovative [AgentGrunt](https://github.com/nikvdp/agentgrunt) project by [@nikvdp](https://github.com/nikvdp). **AGOR retains all of AgentGrunt's capabilities** while adding multi-agent coordination.

**Key Changes from AgentGrunt:**

- **Retained**: All original standalone capabilities and git integration
- **Replaced**: Patch downloads with full file output in codeblocks (preserving comments, formatting, etc.)
- **Added**: Multi-agent coordination, strategic planning, and platform flexibility

## üîÑ Two Operational Modes Explained

### üöÄ Standalone Mode (Direct Git Access)

**When to Use:**

- You have an AI agent with direct repository access
- You want agents to make commits directly (if they have commit access)
- You're using platforms like Augment Code Remote Agents or Jules by Google
- You need real-time collaboration between multiple agents

**How It Works:**

1. Agent clones AGOR repository to learn the protocol
2. Agent clones your target project repository
3. Agent can make direct commits if they have commit access, or use copy-paste codeblocks as fallback
4. Multiple agents can work on the same repository simultaneously
5. Full git history and branch management available

### üì¶ Bundled Mode (Upload-Based Platforms)

**When to Use:**

- You're using upload-based AI platforms (Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, Claude)
- You want to work with free tiers (especially Google AI Studio Pro)
- You prefer manual control over git operations
- You're working with file size limitations

**How It Works:**

1. You bundle your project using AGOR CLI
2. Upload the bundle to your AI platform
3. Agent analyzes and works within the bundled environment. This bundle uniquely includes the **entirety of your codebase and its full Git history (all branches by default)**, giving the AI deep contextual understanding for more accurate analysis and effective editing, a capability not always present in other tools.
4. Agent provides edited files in code blocks
5. You manually copy-paste changes and commit them yourself

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# You run these commands locally
pipx install agor
agor bundle https://github.com/your-username/your-project
# Upload the generated bundle to your AI platform
# Agent works within bundle, you handle git operations
```

## üéØ NEW USERS: Start with Workflow Optimization

**ESSENTIAL READING**: After setup, read [Agent Workflow Optimization Guide](agent-workflow-optimization.md) to learn proven strategies for maintaining seamless agent coordination. This guide contains real-world examples and troubleshooting that will save you time and improve your AGOR experience significantly.

**Why this matters**: AGOR's power comes from seamless agent coordination. The workflow optimization guide teaches you how to structure prompts, maintain context, and avoid common coordination breakdowns that can frustrate new users.

## üé≠ Role Selection Deep Dive

AGOR defines distinct roles that agents (and by extension, users guiding them) can adopt based on the task at hand. Understanding these roles helps in structuring your work with AGOR.

### üîç Worker Agent

**Summary:** The Worker Agent focuses on deep codebase analysis, implementation, debugging, and solo development tasks. It excels at technical deep-dives and can manage complex tasks by preserving detailed progress and context across sessions using snapshots, even for individual use. It operates in both Standalone and Bundled modes.

**Key Uses:**

- Analyzing code, implementing features, debugging.
- Solo development with structured context management (self-snapshots).
- Executing specific tasks within a multi-agent team.

### üìã PROJECT COORDINATOR

**Summary:** The Project Coordinator is responsible for strategic planning, designing multi-agent workflows, breaking down complex requirements, and orchestrating team activities. It initializes coordination strategies and monitors team progress. It operates in both Standalone and Bundled modes.

**Key Uses:**

- Planning new features or projects.
- Designing and initiating multi-agent coordination strategies.
- Creating specialized agent teams and managing their workflow.

## üéº Multi-Agent Coordination Strategies

AGOR is exploring several advanced strategies for multi-agent collaboration. While these are areas of ongoing development and refinement, they illustrate various approaches to coordinating multiple AI agents:

### When to Use Each Strategy

**üîÑ Parallel Divergent** - Multiple independent solutions

- **Use for**: Feature design, architecture decisions, creative problem-solving
- **Roles**: Multiple Worker Agent agents working independently
- **Outcome**: Best ideas synthesized into final solution

**‚ö° Pipeline** - Sequential work via snapshots with specialization

- **Use for**: Complex features requiring different expertise
- **Roles**: Specialized agents (Backend ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí DevOps)
- **Outcome**: Polished, well-integrated solution

**üêù Swarm** - Dynamic task assignment

- **Use for**: Large projects with many independent tasks
- **Roles**: Multiple AGENT WORKER agents pulling from task queue
- **Outcome**: Maximum parallelism and efficiency

**‚öîÔ∏è Red Team** - Adversarial build/break cycles

- **Use for**: Security-critical features, robust system design
- **Roles**: Builder agents vs. Breaker agents
- **Outcome**: Highly robust, security-tested solution

**üë• Mob Programming** - Collaborative coding

- **Use for**: Complex algorithms, learning scenarios, critical code
- **Roles**: Rotating Driver, Navigator, Observers, Researcher
- **Outcome**: High-quality, well-understood code

## üöÄ Getting Started Recommendations

### For Beginners

1. **Start with Bundled Mode** using Google AI Studio Pro (free)
2. **Choose any role** based on what you want to do:
   - **Worker Agent**: For code analysis and implementation
   - **Project Coordinator**: For planning and strategy
3. **Try basic operations like analyzing the codebase, viewing full files, or checking the system status.**
4. **Practice with small projects** before attempting multi-agent workflows

### For Advanced Users

1. **Try Standalone Mode** with git-capable agents
2. **Experiment with different roles** based on your needs
3. **Initialize different multi-agent strategies.**
4. **Use advanced features**: Memory synchronization, custom strategies

### For Teams

1. **Use Standalone Mode** for real-time collaboration
2. **Designate one PROJECT COORDINATOR** for planning
3. **Assign specialized AGENT WORKER** roles
4. **Implement structured snapshot procedures**

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Agent doesn't understand the protocol"

**Solution:** Ensure the agent has loaded both instruction files:

```bash
cat src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md && cat src/agor/tools/README_ai.md
```

### "Multi-agent coordination isn't working"

**Solution:**

1. Check `.agor/` directory exists and has proper files
2. Ensure all agents are regularly synchronizing their work.
3. Verify agents are communicating via `agentconvo.md`

### "Bundle upload fails"

**Solution:**

1. Try different format (`-f zip` vs `-f tar.gz`)
2. Check file size limits on your platform
3. Use `--branch main` to reduce bundle size

### "Git operations fail in bundled mode"

**Expected:** Bundled mode requires manual git operations. Agent provides code, you handle commits.
