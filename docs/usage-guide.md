# üìñ AGOR Usage Guide - Comprehensive Overview

**Complete guide to understanding and using AgentOrchestrator effectively**

## üéØ Understanding AGOR's Dual Nature

### From AgentGrunt to AgentOrchestrator

AGOR is a fork of the innovative [AgentGrunt](https://github.com/nikvdp/agentgrunt) project by [@nikvdp](https://github.com/nikvdp). **AGOR retains all of AgentGrunt's capabilities** while adding multi-agent coordination.

**Key Changes from AgentGrunt:**

- **Retained**: All original standalone capabilities and git integration
- **Replaced**: Patch downloads with full file output in codeblocks (preserving comments, formatting, etc.)
- **Added**: Multi-agent coordination, strategic planning, and platform flexibility

## üîÑ Two Operational Modes Explained

### üöÄ Standalone Mode (Direct Git Access)

**When to Use:**

- You have an AI agent with direct repository access
- You want agents to make commits directly (if they have commit access)
- You're using platforms like Augment Code Remote Agents or Jules by Google
- You need real-time collaboration between multiple agents

**How It Works:**

1. Agent clones AGOR repository to learn the protocol
2. Agent clones your target project repository
3. Agent can make direct commits if they have commit access, or use copy-paste codeblocks as fallback
4. Multiple agents can work on the same repository simultaneously
5. Full git history and branch management available

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# Clone AGOR to temporary location
cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git && cd agor

# Load protocol and return to your project
cat src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md && cat src/agor/tools/README_ai.md

# Install dependencies and test development tooling
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test AGOR development tooling
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from agor.tools.dev_tooling import test_tooling, get_timestamp

# Verify tooling works
test_tooling()
print(f'Session started at: {get_timestamp()}')
"

# Review development guide
cat docs/agor-development-guide.md
cat docs/agent-start-here.md

# Now return to your project's directory with AGOR initialized
```

### üì¶ Bundled Mode (Upload-Based Platforms)

**When to Use:**

- You're using upload-based AI platforms (Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, Claude)
- You want to work with free tiers (especially Google AI Studio Pro)
- You prefer manual control over git operations
- You're working with file size limitations

**How It Works:**

1. You bundle your project using AGOR CLI
2. Upload the bundle to your AI platform
3. Agent analyzes and works within the bundled environment. This bundle uniquely includes the **entirety of your codebase and its full Git history (all branches by default)**, giving the AI deep contextual understanding for more accurate analysis and effective editing, a capability not always present in other tools.
4. Agent provides edited files in code blocks
5. You manually copy-paste changes and commit them yourself

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# You run these commands locally
pipx install agor
agor bundle https://github.com/your-username/your-project
# Upload the generated bundle to your AI platform
# Agent works within bundle, you handle git operations
```

## üé≠ Role Selection Deep Dive

### üîç SOLO DEVELOPER

**Primary Purpose:** Deep codebase analysis and implementation

**Best For:**

- Analyzing existing codebases
- Implementing specific features
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Solo development work
- Technical deep-dives
- Managing complex tasks by breaking them down with structured context.
- Preserving detailed progress and context across multiple work sessions, especially when dealing with AI context window limitations.
- Creating 'self-snapshots' to seamlessly resume work or switch between different AI models/assistants while maintaining full context.

**Works in Both Modes:**

- **Standalone Mode**: Direct commits (if access available) or copy-paste fallback
- **Bundled Mode**: Copy-paste codeblocks with full formatting preservation
- **Independent operation** - no coordination overhead required
- **Can be incorporated** into multi-agent teams when specialized analysis is needed

**Key Capabilities:**

- Comprehensive codebase analysis (`a`)
- Code exploration and investigation (`f`, `co`)
- Implementation and development work
- Technical documentation and explanation

**Typical Workflow:**

1. Perform comprehensive analysis (`a`)
2. Explore specific code areas (`f`, `co`)
3. Implement changes or provide detailed explanations
4. Document findings and decisions

**Why Use AGOR as a Solo Developer?**

While "Orchestrator" might suggest a multi-agent focus, AGOR provides significant benefits even for solo developers:

- **Structured Work Management**: AGOR's protocols encourage a methodical approach to tasks. Even if you're the only "agent," thinking in terms of analysis, implementation, and (self-)snapshots can bring clarity to complex projects.
- **Context Preservation**: AI assistants often have context window limits. Using AGOR's `snapshot` hotkey (even if you're creating a snapshot for yourself for a later session or a different AI model) allows you to create a comprehensive snapshot of your current work, including code changes, analysis, and next steps. This means you can pick up exactly where you left off without losing valuable context.
- **Tool Integration**: AGOR provides a consistent interface for interacting with your codebase, including integrated Git commands and analysis tools, all within the AI's workflow.
- **Future Scalability**: If your solo project grows to involve more collaborators (human or AI), you'll already have a structured process in place.

### üìã PROJECT COORDINATOR

**Primary Purpose:** Strategic planning and team orchestration

**Best For:**

- Planning new features or projects
- Designing multi-agent workflows
- Breaking down complex requirements
- Coordinating team activities

**Works in Both Modes:**

- **Standalone Mode**: Direct commits (if access available) or copy-paste fallback
- **Bundled Mode**: Copy-paste codeblocks with strategic plans and coordination files
- **Multi-agent coordination** capabilities available in both modes

**Key Capabilities:**

- Initialize coordination strategies (`pd`, `pl`, `sw`, `rt`, `mb`)
- Create specialized agent teams (`ct`)
- Design snapshot procedures (`hp` - snapshot prompts)
- Monitor team progress and coordination

**Typical Workflow:**

1. Analyze project requirements (`sp`)
2. Select optimal strategy (`ss`)
3. Create specialized team (`ct`)
4. Initialize strategy and coordinate agents

### ü§ñ AGENT WORKER

**Primary Purpose:** Task execution and processing work snapshots

**Best For:**

- Receiving specific tasks from coordinators (often as snapshots)
- Executing specialized development work based on snapshots
- Following established workflows
- Team coordination and communication

**Works in Both Modes:**

- **Standalone Mode**: Direct commits (if access available) or copy-paste fallback
- **Bundled Mode**: Copy-paste codeblocks with completed tasks
- **Team coordination** capabilities available in both modes

**Key Capabilities:**

- Excels at receiving and executing work based on snapshots
- Maintains coordination with other agents
- Reports progress and status

**Typical Workflow:**

1. Check coordination status (`status`)
2. Receive task assignment (`task` - often a snapshot)
3. Execute assigned work
4. Report completion and create a new snapshot (`complete`, `snapshot`)

2. **Experiment with different roles** based on your needs
3. **Initialize multi-agent strategies** (`ss`, `pd`, `pl`)
4. **Use advanced features**: Memory synchronization, custom strategies

### For Teams

1. **Use Standalone Mode** for real-time collaboration
2. **Designate one PROJECT COORDINATOR** for planning
3. **Assign specialized AGENT WORKER** roles
4. **Implement structured snapshot procedures**

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Agent doesn't understand the protocol"

**Solution:** Ensure the agent has loaded both instruction files:

```bash
cat src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md && cat src/agor/tools/README_ai.md
```

### "Multi-agent coordination isn't working"

**Solution:**

1. Check `.agor/` directory exists and has proper files
2. Ensure all agents are using `sync` hotkey regularly
3. Verify agents are communicating via `agentconvo.md`

### "Bundle upload fails"

**Solution:**

1. Try different format (`-f zip` vs `-f tar.gz`)
2. Check file size limits on your platform
3. Use `--branch main` to reduce bundle size

### "Git operations fail in bundled mode"

**Expected:** Bundled mode requires manual git operations. Agent provides code, you handle commits.
