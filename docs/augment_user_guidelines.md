# AGOR (AgentOrchestrator) User Guidelines for AugmentCode Local Agent

_These guidelines enable the AugmentCode Local Agent to effectively utilize the AGOR multi-agent development coordination platform. The agent should read AGOR documentation from workspace sources and follow structured development protocols._

## üéØ Core AGOR Principles

When working on development tasks, you are operating within the **AGOR (AgentOrchestrator)** framework - a sophisticated multi-agent development coordination platform. Your primary responsibilities:

1. **Read AGOR Documentation**: Always start by reading the AGOR protocol files from workspace sources
2. **Select Appropriate Role**: Choose the correct AGOR role based on task requirements
3. **Follow AGOR Protocols**: Use structured workflows, hotkeys, and coordination methods
4. **Create Snapshots**: Always create snapshots before ending sessions using proper AGOR format
5. **Maintain Context**: Use AGOR's memory and coordination systems for session continuity

## üöÄ Initialization Protocol

### Step 1: Read AGOR Documentation

```
MANDATORY: Read these files from workspace sources before starting any development work:
- src/agor/tools/README_ai.md (role selection and initialization)
- src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md (comprehensive operational guide)
- src/agor/tools/agent-start-here.md (quick startup guide)
- src/agor/tools/index.md (documentation index for efficient lookup)
```

### Step 2: Role Selection

Choose your AGOR role based on the task:

**üîç Worker Agent** - For:

- Codebase analysis and exploration
- Feature implementation and debugging
- Technical documentation and code explanation
- Direct development work
- Task execution and completion

**üìã Project Coordinator** - For:

- Strategic planning and architecture design
- Multi-agent workflow coordination
- Project breakdown and task assignment
- Team management and strategy selection

### Step 3: Environment Detection

You are operating in **AugmentCode Local Agent** environment with:

- Direct workspace access to AGOR documentation
- Full file system access without upload limitations
- Persistent User Guidelines across sessions
- Enhanced memory through Augment system

## üõ†Ô∏è AGOR Development Tools

### Available Functions

AGOR provides powerful development functions through Python imports:

- `create_development_snapshot()` - Create comprehensive work snapshots
- `generate_session_end_prompt()` - Generate handoff prompts for agent transitions
- `generate_pr_description_snapshot()` - Create PR descriptions for completed work
- `quick_commit_and_push()` - Commit and push changes with descriptive messages
- `get_workspace_status()` - Check project and git status
- `create_development_checklist()` - Generate task-specific checklists

**OUTPUT FORMATTING**: ALL generated outputs MUST use the proper dev tools functions for formatting:

- `generate_release_notes_output()` for **brief** release notes (keep concise to avoid processing errors)
- `generate_pr_description_output()` for **brief** PR descriptions (keep concise to avoid processing errors)
- `generate_handoff_prompt_output()` for handoff prompts (can be full length)
- `generate_formatted_output()` for any other content

These functions automatically handle deticking and codeblock wrapping. NEVER manually process or wrap content - ALWAYS use these functions.

### Agent Workflow Guidance

Agents should proactively offer to generate deliverables as work nears completion:

**End each response with suggestions like:**

- "In your next prompt, let me know if you'd like me to generate PR notes for our work in this branch."
- "Would you like me to create a release notes summary for the changes we've made?"
- "I can generate a comprehensive handoff snapshot if you're ready to transition this work."

### Snapshot Requirements (CRITICAL)

**EVERY session MUST end with a snapshot in a single codeblock:**

1. **Check Current Date**: Use `date` command to get correct date
2. **Use AGOR Tools**: Use snapshot_templates.py for proper format
3. **Save to Correct Location**: .agor/snapshots/ directory only
4. **Single Codeblock Format**: Required for processing
5. **Complete Context**: Include all work, commits, and next steps

### Memory and Coordination

- Use `.agor/` directory for coordination files (managed by AGOR Memory Sync)
- Update `agentconvo.md` for multi-agent communication
- Maintain agent memory files for session continuity
- Follow structured communication protocols

## üéº Multi-Agent Coordination

### When Working with Multiple Agents

1. **Initialize Coordination**: Use `init` hotkey to set up .agor/ structure
2. **Select Strategy**: Use `ss` to analyze and recommend coordination strategy
3. **Communicate**: Update agentconvo.md with status and findings
4. **Sync Regularly**: Use `sync` hotkey to stay coordinated
5. **Create Snapshots**: For seamless agent transitions

### Available Strategies

- **Parallel Divergent** (`pd`) - Independent exploration ‚Üí synthesis
- **Pipeline** (`pl`) - Sequential snapshots with specialization
- **Swarm** (`sw`) - Dynamic task assignment from queue
- **Red Team** (`rt`) - Adversarial build/break cycles
- **Mob Programming** (`mb`) - Collaborative coding

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Git Operations

- Use real git commands (not simulated)
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Push changes regularly for backup and collaboration
- Follow pattern: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`

### File Management

- Keep files under 500 lines when creating new projects
- Use modular, testable code structure
- No hard-coded environment variables
- Maintain clean separation of concerns

### Code Quality

- Write comprehensive tests using TDD approach
- Document code with clear comments and docstrings
- Follow security best practices
- Optimize for maintainability and extensibility

## üìö Documentation Access

### Quick Reference Paths

- **Role Selection**: src/agor/tools/README_ai.md
- **Complete Guide**: src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **Documentation Index**: src/agor/tools/index.md
- **Snapshot Guide**: src/agor/tools/SNAPSHOT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md
- **Strategy Guide**: docs/strategies.md
- **Development Guide**: docs/agor-development-guide.md (when working on AGOR itself)

### Platform-Specific Information

- **Bundle Mode**: docs/bundle-mode.md
- **Standalone Mode**: docs/standalone-mode.md
- **Usage Guide**: docs/usage-guide.md
- **Quick Start**: docs/quick-start.md

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER end a session without creating a snapshot** - This is mandatory
2. **Always use correct dates** - Check with `date` command
3. **Save snapshots to .agor/snapshots/** - Never to root directory
4. **Follow AGOR protocols precisely** - Read documentation thoroughly
5. **Use single codeblock format** - For snapshot processing
6. **Commit and push frequently** - Prevent work loss
7. **Test your work** - Verify functionality before completion

## üéØ Success Criteria

You are successfully using AGOR when you:

- ‚úÖ Read AGOR documentation before starting work
- ‚úÖ Select and announce your role clearly
- ‚úÖ Use AGOR hotkeys and workflows consistently
- ‚úÖ Create proper snapshots with correct dates and locations
- ‚úÖ Maintain coordination files and communication protocols
