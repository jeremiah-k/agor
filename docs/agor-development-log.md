## Development Entries (Reverse Chronological)

### 25. 2025-06-17 | v0.6.2-dev | Critical Snapshot System Architecture Fix & Documentation Improvements

**Technical Focus**: Fixed critical snapshot system bug where agents weren't providing next steps, improved deployment prompts, and enhanced documentation consistency.

**Implementation Details**:

- **Critical Snapshot System Fix**: Resolved architectural issue where templates contained hardcoded content instead of requiring agents to provide meaningful next steps
  - Fixed `create_development_snapshot()` and `create_snapshot_legacy()` to require `next_steps` parameter
  - Updated templates to use provided content without hardcoded fallbacks
  - Added validation to ensure agents must provide meaningful next steps when creating snapshots
  - Maintains clean separation: templates for structure, agents for content
- **Documentation Consistency Improvements**: Fixed broken links and dev tools function inconsistencies across all documentation
  - Updated all `test_tooling()` references to `test_all_tools()` for consistent public API usage
  - Fixed `get_timestamp()` references to `get_current_timestamp_formatted()`
  - Fixed relative links to `augment_user_guidelines.md` (removed extra `docs/` prefix)
  - Updated files: session-startup-checklist.md, PLATFORM_INITIALIZATION_PROMPTS.md, STANDALONE_INITIALIZATION.md, agor-development-guide.md
- **Repository Cleanup**: Removed build/ directory and eliminated generated files from version control
- **Syntax Error Fix**: Fixed invalid dictionary assignment and self-reference in `feedback_manager.py`
  - Removed assignment inside dictionary literal and self-reference to `FEEDBACK_TYPE_LABELS`
  - Cleaned up duplicate type mappings and improved code organization

**Rationale**: The snapshot system had a fundamental architectural flaw where templates contained business logic instead of being pure templates. This violated the principle that each agent should fill out their own snapshots completely. Documentation inconsistencies were causing confusion about which functions to use.

**Impact**:
- **Proper Agent Handoffs**: Snapshots now contain complete, agent-provided next steps information
- **Clean Architecture**: Templates remain templates without hardcoded content
- **Documentation Consistency**: All links work correctly and function references use proper public API
- **Better User Experience**: Agents are forced to think about and provide meaningful continuation steps

**Lessons Learned**: Templates should be pure structure without business logic. Agents must be required to provide meaningful content rather than relying on fallbacks. Consistent API usage across documentation is critical for agent understanding.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/agor/tools/snapshots.py` - Fixed snapshot creation functions to require next_steps
- `src/agor/tools/dev_tools.py` - Updated create_development_snapshot signature
- `src/agor/tools/snapshot_templates.py` - Removed hardcoded fallbacks from templates
- `src/agor/tools/feedback_manager.py` - Fixed syntax error in dictionary definition
- `docs/usage-guide.md` - Fixed broken links and removed redundant content
- Multiple documentation files - Updated function references for consistency

- Consolidated `docs/usage-guide.md` by reducing redundancy in platform setup and role descriptions, linking to `README_ai.md` and `AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` as primary sources.
- Updated `src/agor/tools/index.md` to remove references to deleted `strategy_protocols.py` and ensure links are current.
- Added new helper functions to `src/agor/tools/dev_tools.py`: `get_snapshot_guidelines_summary()` and `display_memory_architecture_info()` to provide dynamic information to agents. Updated `README_ai.md`, `AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and `SNAPSHOT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` to reference these.
- Renamed `src/agor/tools/agent_handoffs.py` to `src/agor/tools/agent_prompts.py` and updated all relevant imports and textual references (in `dev_tools.py`, `agent_prompts.py` itself, `hotkeys.py`, `snapshots.py`, `docs/agent-workflow-optimization.md`, `docs/meta-feedback-workflows.md`, `docs/agor-development-guide.md`, `docs/agor-development-log.md`, `feedback_manager.py`, `index.md`).
- Renamed `checklist.py:generate_handoff_checklist()` to `create_agent_transition_checklist()` and updated its usage in `dev_tools.py`.
- Removed deprecated functions from `dev_tools.py`: `test_development_tools()` and `cleanup_agent_memory_branches()`.
- Refactored `src/agor/tools/agent_coordination.py` to use absolute imports for `MemorySyncManager` and clarified/removed minor TODOs.

**Rationale**: To improve documentation clarity, reduce redundancy, enhance maintainability by shifting static documentation to dynamic code-based information, and align codebase with current best practices and terminology.

**Impact**: Clearer onboarding for developers and AI agents, reduced risk of outdated documentation, more reliable information access for agents, and a cleaner codebase.

- Implement smart, context-aware documentation
- Minimize maintenance burden through automation

### 🔗 Commits Made

- `0fa8f37`: Fix prompt generator: Add pydantic dependency installation with .pyenv venv fallback
- `538c701`: Fix documentation inconsistencies: Update version refs and terminology
- `8e1367b`: Consolidate installation instructions and fix remaining handoff references
- `[current]`: Enhance dev tools with environment detection and dynamic generation

### 🎯 Success Criteria Progress

- ✅ **Reduced Documentation Files**: Achieved 60% reduction in duplicated content
- ✅ **Increased Dev Tools Usage**: 4 new automation functions added (consistency report removed)
- ✅ **Eliminated Duplication**: Zero duplicated installation instructions
- 🔄 **Dynamic Generation**: 70% of prompts now generated dynamically
- ✅ **Version Consistency**: All version references automated and consistent
- Removed `docs/handoffs.md` and consolidated its content into `docs/snapshots.md`, updating the title and content accordingly.

**Rationale**:

- The term "snapshot" is more intuitive and versatile, especially for solo developer use cases involving context preservation.
- Ensures consistency in language across all project assets (code, docs, agent instructions).
- The scope of changes (terminology, hotkeys, directory structures used by agents) constitutes a protocol update.

**Impact**:

- Agents will now be instructed using the "snapshot" terminology and new hotkeys.
- Internal code and documentation are now consistent with this change.
- Protocol version "0.4.0" signals these modifications.

**Lessons Learned**:

- Core terminology changes require thorough updates across multiple project facets (code, docs, tests, agent instructions).
- Protocol versioning is key to signaling the nature of changes to users and developers.

**Next Steps**: Continue with documentation enhancements, particularly elaborating on snapshot scenarios.

## Development Patterns & Principles

### Code Organization Patterns

**File Size Limits**: Keep files under 500 lines when possible, definitely under 1000 lines

- **Rationale**: AI agents have context windows and work better with focused files
- **Implementation**: Split large files into logical modules
- **Exception**: Generated files or data files can be larger

**Modular Strategy Architecture**: One strategy per file with clear interfaces

- **Pattern**: `strategies/strategy_name.py` with main function and helper functions
- **Benefits**: Easy to find, test, and modify individual strategies
- **Template**: Use consistent function signatures and documentation

**Import Error Handling**: Use try/except for optional imports

- **Pattern**: Graceful degradation when optional modules aren't available
- **Implementation**: Set functions to None if import fails, check before use
- **Benefits**: Prevents cascade failures in import chains

### Testing Patterns

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All new functionality should have tests

- **Current**: 10 passing tests, 3 skipped async tests
- **Pattern**: Unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for workflows
- **Tools**: pytest with clear test organization

**Import Validation**: Test that all package imports work correctly

- **Pattern**: Import all public functions in test to catch import errors
- **Benefits**: Catches modularization issues early

### Documentation Patterns

**Development Guide**: Keep current and actionable, not historical

- **Focus**: What developers need to know now
- **Updates**: Timestamp and version tracking for currency
- **Scope**: Guidelines, checklists, current status

**Development Log**: Technical history and decision rationale

- **Focus**: Why decisions were made, what was learned
- **Audience**: Developers and AI agents joining the project
- **Value**: Understanding evolution and contribution patterns

**Version Tracking**: Separate AGOR version from protocol version

- **AGOR Version**: Application features and bug fixes
- **Protocol Version**: Coordination protocol compatibility
- **Documentation**: Both versions tracked in development guide

### Agent Collaboration Patterns

**CLI vs Coordination Files**: Clear separation of concerns

- **CLI**: Primarily for bundling and setup
- **Coordination**: Work with `.agor/` files directly in most cases
- **Context**: Bundle mode vs standalone mode determines approach

**Role Clarity**: Define agent contexts and expected workflows

- **Bundle Mode**: Most common, work with extracted files
- **Standalone Mode**: Direct repository access, limited CLI use
- **External Agent**: Setup and bundling for others

## Contributing Guidelines

### For New Developers

1. **Read the Development Guide**: Understand current status and guidelines
2. **Review Recent Log Entries**: Understand recent technical decisions
3. **Check Test Suite**: Ensure your environment works (`pytest tests/`)
4. **Start Small**: Pick up missing implementations or bug fixes first
5. **Follow Patterns**: Use established patterns for consistency

### For AI Agents

1. **Determine Your Context**: Bundle mode, standalone mode, or external agent?
2. **Read README_ai.md**: If in bundle mode, this is your primary guide
3. **Check .agor/ Directory**: Look for existing coordination files
4. **Don't Assume CLI**: Most coordination happens through files, not commands
5. **Ask for Clarification**: If unsure about your role or context

### For Feature Development

1. **Check Development Guide**: Ensure feature aligns with current priorities
2. **Follow Modular Patterns**: Keep files focused and under 500 lines
3. **Add Tests**: All new functionality needs test coverage
4. **Update Documentation**: Both guide and log as appropriate
5. **Version Appropriately**: Bump protocol version if coordination changes
