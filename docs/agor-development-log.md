### 10. 2024-12-19 | Protocol v0.4.0 | Menu Flow and User Experience Enhancement

**Technical Focus**: Creating comprehensive menu flow guidelines and mode-specific initialization paths for better user experience.

**Implementation Details**:

- Created `MENU_FLOW_GUIDE.md` with detailed UX guidelines and templates for all role menus
- Added `STANDALONE_INITIALIZATION.md` for agents with direct git access
- Added `MODE_DETECTION.md` for quick mode identification
- Enhanced all role menus with critical menu flow instructions
- Defined clear action-feedback-menu loop pattern: confirm → execute → results → completion → menu
- Added completion confirmations and next steps guidance to prevent users being left hanging

**Rationale**:

- Bundle mode and standalone mode have different capabilities and should have tailored initialization
- Users need clear feedback loops and consistent experience across all hotkey actions
- Agents were not providing smooth transitions between actions and menus
- Need professional, polished interface that hides technical complexity

**Impact**:

- Clear separation between bundle mode (streamlined, user-friendly) and standalone mode (comprehensive, technical)
- Consistent menu flow pattern across all roles and actions
- Better user experience with clear feedback and next steps
- Professional interface that maintains user engagement

**Lessons Learned**:

- UX consistency requires explicit templates and guidelines for AI agents
- Mode detection and initialization paths need to be clearly separated
- Menu flow patterns must be explicitly defined to prevent agents from leaving users hanging
- Professional user experience requires hiding technical implementation details

**Next Steps**: Test the improved menu flow with real users and refine based on feedback.

### 9. 2024-12-19 | Protocol v0.4.0 | Bundle Mode Menu Display Fix

**Technical Focus**: Fixing bundle mode initialization where agents were showing internal function calls instead of clean user menus.

**Implementation Details**:

- Created `BUNDLE_INITIALIZATION.md` for streamlined bundle mode setup with clear step-by-step instructions
- Added critical warnings in `AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` Section 4 to prevent showing technical documentation to users
- Strengthened menu display instructions for all three roles (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, Agent Worker)
- Updated `README_ai.md` to clearly distinguish between bundle mode and standalone mode initialization paths
- Added explicit "DO NOT SHOW TO USERS" warnings for internal technical documentation

**Rationale**:

- Bundle mode users were seeing technical function calls like `tree('.')`, `grep('.', 'def ')`, `analyze_file_structure(path)` instead of clean menu options
- This created a poor user experience and exposed internal implementation details
- Need clear separation between user-facing menus and internal technical documentation
- Bundle mode requires more streamlined initialization than standalone mode

**Impact**:

- Bundle mode agents should now display clean, professional menus instead of technical function names
- Clear distinction between bundle mode (streamlined) and standalone mode (comprehensive) initialization
- Better user experience with polished interface
- Internal technical documentation properly hidden from end users

**Lessons Learned**:

- Bundle mode and standalone mode have different UX requirements and should have separate initialization paths
- AI agents need very explicit instructions about what to show vs. hide from users
- Technical documentation sections need clear warnings to prevent accidental exposure
- Menu display instructions need to be strengthened with "CRITICAL" and "EXACTLY" language

**Next Steps**: Test bundle mode initialization with real AI platforms to verify the fix works correctly.

### 8. YYYY-MM-DD | Protocol v0.4.0 | Terminology and Hotkey Update (Snapshot)

**Technical Focus**: Standardizing core terminology from "handoff" to "snapshot" across the project, updating associated hotkeys, and bumping the protocol version to reflect these conceptual changes.

**Implementation Details**:

- Changed `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in `src/agor/constants.py` from "0.3.0" to "0.4.0".
- Renamed directory reference `.agor/handoffs/` to `.agor/snapshots/` in all code and documentation.
- Renamed Python module `src/agor/tools/handoff_templates.py` to `src/agor/tools/snapshot_templates.py` and updated all imports.
- Renamed relevant functions, variables, and constants (e.g., `generate_handoff_document` to `generate_snapshot_document`).
- Updated hotkeys in `src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
  - `handoff` → `snapshot`
  - `receive` → `load_snapshot`
  - `snapshots` → `list_snapshots`
- Performed a global replacement of "handoff" terminology with "snapshot" in all relevant documentation and code comments/strings.

## 🔧 v0.4.1-3 Development Session (2025-06-05)

**Focus**: Memory Manager Fixes, Documentation Consolidation, and Dev Tooling Enhancement

### 🎯 Memory Manager Pydantic Dependencies Fix

---

## Development Patterns & Principles

### Code Organization Patterns

**File Size Limits**: Keep files under 500 lines when possible, definitely under 1000 lines

- **Rationale**: AI agents have context windows and work better with focused files
- **Implementation**: Split large files into logical modules
- **Exception**: Generated files or data files can be larger

**Modular Strategy Architecture**: One strategy per file with clear interfaces

- **Pattern**: `strategies/strategy_name.py` with main function and helper functions
- **Benefits**: Easy to find, test, and modify individual strategies
- **Template**: Use consistent function signatures and documentation

**Import Error Handling**: Use try/except for optional imports

- **Pattern**: Graceful degradation when optional modules aren't available
- **Implementation**: Set functions to None if import fails, check before use
- **Benefits**: Prevents cascade failures in import chains

### Testing Patterns

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All new functionality should have tests

- **Current**: 10 passing tests, 3 skipped async tests
- **Pattern**: Unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for workflows
- **Tools**: pytest with clear test organization

**Import Validation**: Test that all package imports work correctly

- **Pattern**: Import all public functions in test to catch import errors
- **Benefits**: Catches modularization issues early

### Documentation Patterns

**Development Guide**: Keep current and actionable, not historical

- **Focus**: What developers need to know now
- **Updates**: Timestamp and version tracking for currency
- **Scope**: Guidelines, checklists, current status

**Development Log**: Technical history and decision rationale

- **Focus**: Why decisions were made, what was learned
- **Audience**: Developers and AI agents joining the project
- **Value**: Understanding evolution and contribution patterns

**Version Tracking**: Separate AGOR version from protocol version

- **AGOR Version**: Application features and bug fixes
- **Protocol Version**: Coordination protocol compatibility
- **Documentation**: Both versions tracked in development guide

### Agent Collaboration Patterns

**CLI vs Coordination Files**: Clear separation of concerns

- **CLI**: Primarily for bundling and setup
- **Coordination**: Work with `.agor/` files directly in most cases
- **Context**: Bundle mode vs standalone mode determines approach

**Role Clarity**: Define agent contexts and expected workflows

- **Bundle Mode**: Most common, work with extracted files
- **Standalone Mode**: Direct repository access, limited CLI use
- **External Agent**: Setup and bundling for others

## Contributing Guidelines

### For New Developers

1. **Read the Development Guide**: Understand current status and guidelines
2. **Review Recent Log Entries**: Understand recent technical decisions
3. **Check Test Suite**: Ensure your environment works (`pytest tests/`)
4. **Start Small**: Pick up missing implementations or bug fixes first
5. **Follow Patterns**: Use established patterns for consistency

### For AI Agents

1. **Determine Your Context**: Bundle mode, standalone mode, or external agent?
2. **Read README_ai.md**: If in bundle mode, this is your primary guide
3. **Check .agor/ Directory**: Look for existing coordination files
4. **Don't Assume CLI**: Most coordination happens through files, not commands
5. **Ask for Clarification**: If unsure about your role or context

### For Feature Development

1. **Check Development Guide**: Ensure feature aligns with current priorities
2. **Follow Modular Patterns**: Keep files focused and under 500 lines
3. **Add Tests**: All new functionality needs test coverage
4. **Update Documentation**: Both guide and log as appropriate
5. **Version Appropriately**: Bump protocol version if coordination changes
