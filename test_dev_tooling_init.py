# AGOR Refactoring Project - Session Start

## Project Overview
Working on comprehensive AGOR improvements based on review findings:

### High Priority Issues:
1. **Git Safety**: Implement safe_git_push function (no force push without safeguards)
2. **Dev Tooling Modularization**: Break down 2446-line dev_tooling.py into focused modules
3. **Memory Branch Architecture**: Change from orphan branches to 1-commit-behind-HEAD
4. **Role System**: Update Project Coordinator role, simplify to 2 roles (Worker Agent + PC)

### Current Status:
- ✅ Dev tooling initialized and tested
- ✅ Review work file deleted as requested
- 🔄 Starting Phase 1: Git safety implementation

### Next Steps:
1. Implement safe_git_push function with upstream checking
2. Update quick_commit_push to use safe push
3. Fix memory branch creation logic
4. Update role documentation

## Technical Notes:
- Using existing dev tooling throughout
- Will create snapshots and memories frequently
- All prompt outputs must use detick method for proper codeblock rendering
- Working as Agent Worker role until instructed otherwise

# Git Safety Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

## Completed Work:
1. ✅ **Implemented safe_git_push() function** with comprehensive safety checks:
   - Pull before push to check upstream changes
   - Protected branch validation (main, master, develop, production)
   - Explicit force push requirements (double confirmation needed)
   - Upstream change detection and merge requirement
   - Detailed safety messaging and error handling

2. ✅ **Updated existing push operations**:
   - quick_commit_push() now uses safe_git_push()
   - Memory branch pushes use safe_git_push()
   - All push operations now have safety checks

3. ✅ **Safety Features**:
   - Never allows force push to protected branches
   - Requires explicit_force=True AND force=True for force pushes
   - Fetches before push to detect upstream changes
   - Fails safely if merge/rebase needed

## Next Steps:
1. Fix memory branch architecture (1 commit behind HEAD vs orphan)
2. Update role documentation (Project Coordinator emphasis)
3. Simplify to 2 roles (Worker Agent + Project Coordinator)
4. Modularize dev tooling

## Technical Notes:
- All existing functionality preserved
- Backward compatible implementation
- Enhanced safety without breaking workflows

# Memory Branch Architecture Test

## Testing Updated Memory Branch Creation:
- Changed from orphan branches to 1-commit-behind-HEAD approach
- Easier switching and merge prevention
- Less complex than going back hundreds of commits
- Better integration with git workflows

## Architecture Benefits:
1. **Easier Navigation**: Memory branches are related to working branches
2. **Merge Prevention**: 1 commit behind prevents accidental merges
3. **Simpler Logic**: No complex empty tree creation
4. **Better Performance**: Faster branch creation and switching

# Role System Updates - Phase 3 Complete

## Completed Work:
1. ✅ **Enhanced Project Coordinator Role**:
   - Updated multi-agent-protocols.md with strategic oversight emphasis
   - Added task delegation, progress tracking, quality assurance
   - Included code review responsibilities as requested
   - Clear delegation model vs direct execution

2. ✅ **Simplified to 2-Role System**:
   - Consolidated Solo Developer + Agent Worker → Worker Agent
   - Worker Agent: Can work solo or in multi-agent teams
   - Project Coordinator: Strategic oversight and delegation
   - Updated README_ai.md and AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md

3. ✅ **Updated Documentation**:
   - README_ai.md: Enhanced PC role description
   - AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md: Consolidated role sections and menus
   - multi-agent-protocols.md: Strategic coordinator philosophy
   - Removed old 3-role references

## Role Philosophy:
- **Worker Agent**: Technical execution (solo or coordinated)
- **Project Coordinator**: Strategic oversight, delegation, code review

## Next Steps:
1. Modularize dev tooling (break down 2500+ line file)
2. Update all import references
3. Test functionality preservation
4. Create comprehensive snapshot
