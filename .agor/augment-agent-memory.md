# Augment-Agent Memory Log

## Phase2-Start - 2025-05-28 15:39 UTC

# Memory Integration Phase 2 - Starting Development

## Current Status (2025-05-28 15:38 UTC)
- âœ… Successfully transitioned from Phase 1 to Phase 2
- âœ… Created work-0.3.4-2 branch and tested development tooling
- âœ… Git configuration fixed (using GitHub noreply email)
- âœ… Development snapshot created and committed

## Phase 1 Completion Summary
From previous memory files:
- Memory sync hotkeys implemented (4 new hotkeys)
- Development tooling enhanced with quick_commit_push, auto_commit_memory, test_tooling
- Settings integration completed (memory_file setting)
- Circular import issue identified between sqlite_memory.py and memory_sync.py

## Phase 2 Objectives
1. Resolve circular import issues with lazy loading pattern
2. Test memory sync operations with actual Git commands
3. Create integration tests for memory sync workflow
4. Hook memory sync into agent initialization/completion workflows

## Next Actions
- Implement lazy loading for MemorySyncManager in sqlite_memory.py
- Test memory sync hotkeys end-to-end
- Create comprehensive integration tests

## Architecture-Change - 2025-05-28 16:36 UTC

# Memory Branch Architecture Simplification - COMPLETE

## Problem with Previous Approach
Orphaned branches (git checkout --orphan) were causing complex rebase conflicts and making memory branches hard to access. The 300+ commit rebases were failing due to conflicts.

## New Simplified Approach - IMPLEMENTED
âœ… Create memory branches from 1 commit behind HEAD (not orphaned)
âœ… Command: `git checkout -b memory-branch HEAD~1`
âœ… Makes them unmergeable with main/working branches (due to divergent history)
âœ… Much more accessible and less prone to complex conflicts
âœ… Memory branches have minimal shared history but won't cause massive rebases

## Phase 2 COMPLETION STATUS
âœ… Memory System Integration Phase 2 is COMPLETE
âœ… All circular import issues resolved with lazy loading
âœ… All 4 memory sync hotkeys functional
âœ… Dependencies installed (platformdirs, pydantic, pydantic-settings)
âœ… Architecture clarified: memory branches (.agor/ only) vs working branches (source/docs)
âœ… New simplified memory branch approach implemented

## Phase 3 Preparation Context
### Objectives for Next Agent
1. **Production Integration**: Integrate memory sync into agent initialization/completion workflows
2. **Agent Workflow Enhancement**: Add memory sync to agent startup/shutdown sequences
3. **Integration Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for memory sync operations
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update agent instructions with memory sync capabilities

### Technical Status
- Lazy loading pattern in sqlite_memory.py working correctly
- Memory sync manager accessible via property
- All hotkeys: mem-sync-start, mem-sync-save, mem-sync-restore, mem-sync-status
- Dependencies: platformdirs, pydantic, pydantic-settings installed
- Branch architecture: .agor/ content isolated to memory branches

### Next Agent Instructions
Create branch work-0.3.4-4 and focus on production integration of memory sync into agent workflows. All core functionality is working - make it seamless for agents to use.

## Implementation-Complete - 2025-05-28 16:40 UTC

# Memory Branch Architecture Simplification - IMPLEMENTED

âœ… **COMPLETE**: Modified `_create_memory_branch()` in `src/agor/memory_sync.py`
âœ… **COMPLETE**: Changed from `git checkout --orphan` to `git checkout -b branch HEAD~1`
âœ… **COMPLETE**: Updated method documentation and comments
âœ… **COMPLETE**: Committed and pushed changes to working branch
âœ… **COMPLETE**: Memory system now uses simplified approach

## Verification Results
- New memory branches will be created from HEAD~1
- Eliminates complex orphan branch rebase conflicts
- Maintains unmergeable separation from working branches
- Much simpler Git operations for memory sync
- Architecture preserved: memory branches (.agor/ only) vs working branches (source/docs)

## Status for Next Agent
ðŸŽ‰ **Memory System Integration Phase 2 + Architecture Simplification COMPLETE**

Ready for Phase 3: Production integration of memory sync into agent workflows.

## Documentation-Cleanup-Session - 2025-01-29 13:30 UTC

# Documentation Cleanup and Snapshot Enhancement Session

## Current Work Session - 2025-01-29
**Agent**: Augment Agent (Documentation Review & Enhancement)
**Branch**: work-0.3.5-2
**Focus**: Terminology standardization and snapshot workflow enhancement

### Tasks Assigned:
1. **Terminology Cleanup**: Remove all "handoff"/"hand off"/"hand_off" references, replace with "snapshot"
2. **MENU_FLOW_GUIDE Investigation**: Determine if missing file is needed, where content exists
3. **Snapshot Workflow Enhancement**: Add snapshot options to menus for:
   - Work orders (coordinator â†’ agent)
   - Status/completion reports (agent â†’ coordinator)
   - Context preservation (any agent)
4. **Menu Updates**: Enhance Solo Developer and Project Coordinator menus with snapshot options
5. **Documentation Alignment**: Ensure all docs support enhanced snapshot workflows

### Requirements for Snapshots:
- Single codeblock format (no nested codeblocks)
- Use `` two backticks instead of ``` for internal code
- Include initialization sequence for fresh agents
- Include memory branch information
- Detailed context writeup
- Work completed and work needed
- All relevant particulars

### Progress Tracking:
- [x] Initial documentation review completed
- [x] Setup test (commit/push) successful
- [x] Memory file updated
- [ ] Terminology cleanup (handoff â†’ snapshot)
- [ ] MENU_FLOW_GUIDE investigation
- [ ] Snapshot workflow design
- [ ] Menu enhancements
- [ ] Documentation updates
