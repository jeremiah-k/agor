**Agent**: Augment Agent (Software Engineering)
**Branch**: work-0.6.4-1
**Commit**: 7eb82c9
**AGOR Version**: 0.6.3

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Context

User requested creation of new branch work-0.6.4-1 (noting not to focus heavily on version numbers as this is just their dev work pattern) and comprehensive updates to initialization prompts to address critical venv management issues.

CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Current initialization prompts were causing agents to create and sometimes commit venv directories in user project directories, which is undesirable. User emphasized that venv should be created in the same location as AGOR files to prevent committing venv to project repositories.

USER'S STRATEGIC REASONING AND REQUIREMENTS:
- For local agents: venv should be created in AGOR source directory (example: ~/dev/agor/.venv)
- For remote agents: venv should be created in /tmp/agor/.venv to avoid any commit issues
- This ensures venv is never committed while using AGOR tools
- User wants uniform documentation throughout the project reflecting this approach

ADDITIONAL USER REQUIREMENTS:
- Move placeholder comments to bottom of codeblocks (no reason for AI to have them in middle)
- Perform general consistency check after recent updates - comprehensive audit approach
- Gear towards making more verbose snapshots as recently discussed (transcriptionist-level)
- Ensure all documentation is mirrored in both places (agent tools and docs directories)
- Check that index.md is up to date and verify programmatic index functionality

USER'S PHILOSOPHY ON COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT CAPTURE:
User emphasized that snapshots should be like transcriptionist records capturing full essence of user reasoning, ideally word-for-word. They want agents to understand that comprehensive context capture is critical for effective agent handoffs and continuity. This includes capturing every detailed explanation, decision-making process, strategic thinking, technical preferences, and the complete rationale behind every choice made.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
- Updated PLATFORM_INITIALIZATION_PROMPTS.md for all platforms (AugmentCode Local, Remote, Google AI Studio, ChatGPT)
- Modified AugmentCode Local to use ~/dev/agor/.venv with explicit navigation to AGOR directory
- Updated AugmentCode Remote to use /tmp/agor/.venv with proper venv creation in AGOR directory
- Moved placeholder comments to bottom of all initialization prompts
- Enhanced snapshot_templates.py with comprehensive docstring about transcriptionist-level context capture
- Updated agent_reference.py with detailed example of comprehensive context capture
- Enhanced index.md with notes about comprehensive context capture requirements
- Added emphasis on detailed, comprehensive snapshots in all platform prompts

CONSISTENCY AUDIT PERFORMED:
- Verified all platform prompts now emphasize comprehensive context capture
- Ensured uniform venv management approach across all platforms
- Updated documentation to reflect transcriptionist-level snapshot requirements
- Enhanced code comments and examples to demonstrate proper context capture
- Confirmed index.md reflects recent comprehensive context capture enhancements

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Test updated initialization prompts across all platforms to verify venv is created in correct locations
2. Verify that agents following new prompts create comprehensive, transcriptionist-level snapshots
3. Monitor for any issues with venv creation in AGOR directories vs project directories
4. Gather feedback on whether the enhanced context capture guidance improves snapshot quality
5. Consider creating additional examples or templates demonstrating excellent comprehensive context capture
6. Evaluate if any other documentation needs updating to reflect the venv management changes
7. Test the programmatic index functions to ensure they reflect recent enhancements
8. Document any patterns that emerge from improved comprehensive context capture practices
