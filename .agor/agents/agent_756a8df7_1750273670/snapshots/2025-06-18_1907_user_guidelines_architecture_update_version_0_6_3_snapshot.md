2. Verify that agents properly use dev tools instead of manual .agor file operations
3. Monitor adoption of quick_commit_and_push() for improved workflow efficiency
4. Gather feedback on the revised guidelines focusing on mature features
5. Consider creating video tutorials for the dev tools workflow
6. Plan testing of experimental multi-agent strategies before re-emphasizing them
