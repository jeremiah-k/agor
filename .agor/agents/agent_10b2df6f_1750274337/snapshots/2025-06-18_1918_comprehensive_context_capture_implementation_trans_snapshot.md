## ðŸŽ¯ Development Context

User identified a critical issue with snapshot context capture - my snapshots were lacking comprehensive context and missing the rich reasoning they provided in their detailed instructions. They emphasized that snapshots should be like transcriptionist records that capture the full essence of user reasoning, ideally word-for-word, but at minimum the complete context and decision-making process.

The user specifically explained their philosophy: snapshots need to communicate comprehensive user context including every detailed explanation they provide, their decision-making process and rationale, strategic thinking and long-term vision, priorities and emphasis, technical preferences and requirements, and the philosophy behind architectural choices. They want agents to capture the user voice and reasoning patterns, not just brief summaries of what was accomplished.

User provided specific guidance that this transcriptionist-level context capture needs to be communicated throughout the snapshot system documentation, AGOR instructions, README_ai.md, and agent resources. They emphasized that agents should never manually interact with snapshots - all memory management must be done using dev tools. They also highlighted the importance of quick_commit_and_push() functionality for efficiency and branch synchronization when multiple users/agents are working on projects.

The user noted that multi-agent coordination strategies are largely untested and need more work, preferring to focus on the snapshot/memory branch system and dev tools as the more developed features that should be emphasized. They want users to understand these mature features and how to use them effectively.

This represents a fundamental improvement to the AGOR system because proper comprehensive context capture is essential for effective agent handoffs and continuity. The user wants snapshots to read like detailed transcripts that capture the full richness of their input and thinking, not brief summaries that lose critical context and reasoning.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Test the updated documentation with real agent deployments to verify comprehensive context capture
2. Monitor snapshot quality to ensure agents are following the transcriptionist-level approach
3. Gather feedback on whether the enhanced context capture improves agent handoff quality
4. Consider creating examples or templates that demonstrate excellent context capture
5. Evaluate if additional training or guidance is needed for agents to master this approach
6. Document any patterns or best practices that emerge from improved context capture
7. Assess impact on agent continuity and decision-making quality with richer snapshots
