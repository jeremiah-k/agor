# AGENT3 Instructions

## Mission

implement e2e encryption for login system

## Your Branch

`agent3/implement-e2e-encryp`

## Strategy: Parallel Divergent

You are working **independently** with 2 other agents on the same problem.

### Phase 1: Divergent Execution (Current)

1. **Switch to your branch**: `git checkout agent3/implement-e2e-encryp`
2. **Work independently** - no coordination with other agents
3. **Implement your solution** using your unique approach
4. **Commit regularly** with clear messages
5. **Document your approach** in your solution

### Phase 2: Convergent Review (Later)

- Review other agents' solutions
- Provide constructive feedback
- Identify best practices and innovations

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Final)

- Collaborate to merge best approaches
- Create final unified solution

## Success Criteria

- Complete, working implementation
- Clear documentation of your approach
- Code that passes existing tests
- Innovative or unique perspective on the problem

## Communication

- Update `.agor/agentconvo.md` with major progress
- Use your agent memory file: `.agor/agent3-memory.md`
- No coordination during Phase 1 - work independently!

## Ready to Start?

1. `git checkout agent3/implement-e2e-encryp`
2. Begin your independent implementation
3. Focus on your unique approach to the problem
