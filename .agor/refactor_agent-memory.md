# Dev Tooling Modularization - Phase 4 Progress

## Completed Work:
1. ✅ **Created Specialized Modules**:
   - git_operations.py: Safe git operations and timestamp utilities
   - memory_manager.py: Cross-branch memory commits and branch management
   - agent_handoffs.py: Agent coordination and handoff utilities
   - dev_testing.py: Testing utilities and environment detection

2. ✅ **Module Features**:
   - git_operations: safe_git_push, quick_commit_push, timestamp functions
   - memory_manager: commit_to_memory_branch, auto_commit_memory
   - agent_handoffs: detick_content, generate_handoff_prompt_only, session end prompts
   - dev_testing: test_tooling, detect_environment, installation commands

3. ✅ **Import Testing**:
   - All new modules import successfully
   - Functions work as expected
   - Backward compatibility maintained

## Next Steps:
1. Update main dev_tooling.py to import from modules
2. Remove duplicate functions from main file
3. Update all references throughout codebase
4. Test comprehensive functionality
5. Create final snapshot and PR description

## Technical Notes:
- Modular approach reduces file size from 2500+ lines
- Better organization and maintainability
- Preserved all existing functionality
- Enhanced safety and testing capabilities
