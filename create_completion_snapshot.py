**Generated**: 2025-06-05 19:15 UTC
**Agent**: Augment Agent (Software Engineering)
**Branch**: work-0.3.8-1
**Commit**: 31d64d8
**AGOR Version**: 0.3.3 ‚Üí 0.3.4 development

## üéØ Development Context

### Task Completed: Prompt Content Preparation System

Successfully implemented and tested a prompt content preparation system that solves the formatting issues when creating agent handoff snapshots.

### Problem Solved
When agents create snapshots containing code examples with triple backticks (```) and these snapshots are placed inside single codeblocks for agent initialization prompts, the nested triple backticks break the formatting and create visual garbage in agent UIs.

### Solution Implemented
- **Added**: `prepare_prompt_content()` function in `dev_tooling.py`
- **Functionality**: Converts triple backticks (```) to double backticks (``) 
- **Safety**: Handles quadruple backticks from previous escaping
- **Preservation**: Code content is preserved, only backticks are escaped
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive explanation in AGOR development guide

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. src/agor/tools/dev_tooling.py
- Added `prepare_prompt_content()` method to DevTooling class
- Added convenience function `prepare_prompt_content()` for easy access
- Comprehensive docstring explaining the reasoning and usage

```python
def prepare_prompt_content(self, content: str) -> str:
    """
    Prepare content for use in single codeblock prompts by escaping nested codeblocks.
    
    This function reduces triple backticks (```) to double backticks (``) to prevent
    formatting issues when the content is placed inside a single codeblock for agent handoffs.
    """
    # Replace triple backticks with double backticks to prevent codeblock nesting issues
    escaped_content = content.replace('```', '``')
    
    # Also handle any quadruple backticks that might exist (from previous escaping)
    escaped_content = escaped_content.replace('````', '```')
    
    return escaped_content
```

#### 2. docs/agor-development-guide.md
- Added "Memory System Architecture" section
- Documented prompt content preparation reasoning
- Explained the visual clarity benefits
- Added technical details about single codeblock requirements

### Testing Completed
- ‚úÖ Function correctly converts triple to double backticks
- ‚úÖ Code content is preserved during conversion
- ‚úÖ Memory system integration works properly
- ‚úÖ Snapshots can be stored and recalled from memory branches
- ‚úÖ Prepared content is safe for single codeblock usage

### Usage Instructions
When creating snapshots for agent handoffs:

```python
from agor.tools.dev_tooling import prepare_prompt_content

# Prepare snapshot content for clean handoff
raw_snapshot = "Your snapshot content with ```code``` blocks"
clean_snapshot = prepare_prompt_content(raw_snapshot)

# Now clean_snapshot can be safely placed in single codeblocks
```

### Memory System Status
- ‚úÖ Cross-branch memory operations working
- ‚úÖ Branch safety maintained (never switches working branch)
- ‚úÖ Memory branches use `agor/mem/*` naming convention
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback to regular commits if memory operations fail
- ‚úÖ Remote sync capabilities for multi-agent coordination

### Git Status
- **Current Branch**: work-0.3.8-1
- **Changes Committed**: All prompt preparation functionality
- **Memory Branches**: Cleaned (deleted old test branches)
- **Remote Status**: Synced

### Files Modified
- `src/agor/tools/dev_tooling.py` - Added prompt preparation functionality
- `docs/agor-development-guide.md` - Added architecture documentation
- `test_prompt_preparation.py` - Created test script for verification

### Next Steps
The prompt preparation system is complete and ready for use. Any time agents need to create snapshots for handoffs, they should use `prepare_prompt_content()` to ensure clean formatting when the content is placed in single codeblocks.

This solves the "garbage formatting" issue identified in the user screenshot and enables seamless agent handoffs with properly formatted prompts.

## üìã Implementation Summary

**Problem**: Nested codeblocks in agent handoff prompts break UI formatting
**Solution**: Escape triple backticks to double backticks for single codeblock safety
**Result**: Clean, readable agent initialization prompts
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and tested
