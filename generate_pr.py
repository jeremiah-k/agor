pr_description = """# 🚀 AGOR Comprehensive Refactoring and Safety Improvements

## 📋 Overview

This PR implements comprehensive improvements to AGOR based on review findings, focusing on safety, modularity, and enhanced coordination capabilities.

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. 🛡️ Git Safety Implementation
- **Implemented `safe_git_push()` function** with comprehensive safety checks
- **Protected branch validation**: Never allows force push to main, master, develop, production
- **Upstream change detection**: Fetches and checks for remote changes before pushing
- **Explicit force requirements**: Requires double confirmation for force pushes
- **Enhanced error handling**: Detailed safety messaging and graceful failures

### 2. 🏗️ Memory Branch Architecture Fix
- **Changed from orphan branches to 1-commit-behind-HEAD approach**
- **Easier navigation**: Memory branches are now related to working branches
- **Merge prevention**: 1 commit behind prevents accidental merges
- **Simpler logic**: No complex empty tree creation required
- **Better performance**: Faster branch creation and switching

### 3. 👥 Role System Enhancement
- **Enhanced Project Coordinator role** with strategic oversight emphasis
- **Added code review responsibilities** as requested in review
- **Simplified to 2-role system**: Worker Agent + Project Coordinator
- **Updated all documentation**: README_ai.md, AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md, multi-agent-protocols.md
- **Clear delegation model**: PC focuses on oversight, not direct execution

### 4. 🧩 Dev Tooling Modularization
- **Broke down 2500+ line dev_tooling.py** into focused modules:
  - `git_operations.py`: Safe git operations and timestamp utilities
  - `memory_manager.py`: Cross-branch memory commits and branch management
  - `agent_handoffs.py`: Agent coordination and handoff utilities
  - `dev_testing.py`: Testing utilities and environment detection
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: All existing functions still work
- **Enhanced organization**: Better maintainability and separation of concerns

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Modules Created:
- `src/agor/tools/git_operations.py` - Git safety and operations
- `src/agor/tools/memory_manager.py` - Memory branch management
- `src/agor/tools/agent_handoffs.py` - Agent coordination utilities
- `src/agor/tools/dev_testing.py` - Testing and environment detection

### Updated Files:
- `src/agor/tools/dev_tooling.py` - Updated to import from modules with backward compatibility
- `docs/multi-agent-protocols.md` - Enhanced Project Coordinator role description
- `src/agor/tools/README_ai.md` - Updated role descriptions and selection
- `src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Simplified to 2-role system

### Removed Files:
- `review_work-0.4.3-2_summary.md` - Cleaned up as requested

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Git Safety Features:
```python
def safe_git_push(branch_name=None, force=False, explicit_force=False):
    # Comprehensive safety checks:
    # - Protected branch validation
    # - Upstream change detection
    # - Explicit force confirmation
    # - Detailed error messaging
```

### Memory Branch Architecture:
```bash
# OLD: Orphan branches (complex)
git checkout --orphan memory_branch

# NEW: 1 commit behind HEAD (simple)
git update-ref refs/heads/memory_branch HEAD~1
```

### Modular Organization:
```python
# Main interface with specialized imports
from .git_operations import safe_git_push, quick_commit_push
from .memory_manager import auto_commit_memory, commit_to_memory_branch
from .agent_handoffs import generate_handoff_prompt_only, detick_content
from .dev_testing import test_tooling, detect_environment
```

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ **All new modules tested** and working correctly
- ✅ **Backward compatibility verified** - existing code unchanged
- ✅ **Git safety tested** with comprehensive scenarios
- ✅ **Memory operations tested** with new architecture
- ✅ **Role documentation validated** across all files
- ✅ **Import functionality confirmed** in all environments

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Safety**: No more dangerous git operations without explicit confirmation
2. **Better Architecture**: Simplified memory branch management
3. **Improved Coordination**: Enhanced Project Coordinator role with code review
4. **Better Maintainability**: Modular code organization
5. **Preserved Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing workflows

## 🚀 Next Steps

This PR addresses all review findings and provides a solid foundation for:
- Enhanced agent coordination workflows
- Safer development operations
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Improved multi-agent collaboration

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None** - All existing functionality is preserved through backward compatibility layers.

## 📞 Review Notes

This PR directly addresses the review findings from work-0.4.3-2:
- ✅ Git safety violations fixed
- ✅ Role inconsistencies resolved
- ✅ Code organization improved
- ✅ Memory branch architecture simplified
- ✅ All functionality preserved and enhanced

---

**Ready for review and merge** - Comprehensive testing completed, all objectives achieved."""
