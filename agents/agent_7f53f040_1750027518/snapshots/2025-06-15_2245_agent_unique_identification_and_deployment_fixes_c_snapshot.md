## ðŸŽ¯ Development Context

All requested fixes have been completed successfully:

âœ… COMPLETED TASKS:
1. Added tqdm to agent-requirements.txt for missing dependency
2. Added get_available_functions_reference() to deployment prompts for both AugmentCode Local Agent and Standalone Mode
3. Removed redundant import of sanitize_slug in snapshots.py (line 92)
4. Removed unused os import in dev_tools.py (line 406)
5. Fixed generate_unique_agent_id() to sanitize returned agent ID
6. Fixed create_handoff_prompt() to sanitize agent_id parameter
7. Fixed check_pending_handoffs() to properly restore original branch
8. Fixed relative links in docs/usage-guide.md to include docs/ prefix
9. Removed example user prompts section from usage-guide.md as requested
10. Added get_available_functions_reference() as MANDATORY function in README_ai.md

âœ… BRANCH SAFETY VERIFIED:
- All functions that switch branches now have proper try-finally restoration
- Memory operations use commit_to_memory_branch() which NEVER switches branches
- No tools will leave users on wrong branch

âœ… DEPLOYMENT UPDATES:
- Both deployment sections now include pip install -r agent-requirements.txt
- Both deployment sections now call get_available_functions_reference() to show available functions
- All platforms have consistent setup instructions

âœ… CODE QUALITY:
- Removed redundant imports and unused code
- Fixed all path sanitization issues
- Ensured proper error handling and branch restoration

The branch agent-unique-identification is ready for PR merge with all fixes implemented and tested.
