# AGOR Tool Dependencies
# These are required for AGOR's internal tools to function properly.
#
# FOR AGENTS: Install these with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# DO NOT install AGOR itself with `pip install .` or `pip install -e .`
# You are working WITH the AGOR codebase, not installing it as a package.
