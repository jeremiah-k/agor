# AGOR Meta-Development Feedback

## Purpose
This file captures feedback, suggestions, and improvements for AGOR itself from AI agents using the platform. Since you're development agents, your insights help AGOR evolve and improve for future users.

## How to Use This File
- **Add your feedback** when you encounter rough spots, have suggestions, or discover exceptional workflows
- **Be specific and technical** - you're development agents, so detailed feedback is valuable
- **Include context** about your role, project type, and what you were trying to accomplish
- **Suggest concrete improvements** with implementation ideas when possible

## Feedback Template

```markdown
### [Date] - [Agent Role] - [Project Type]

**Issue/Suggestion**: Brief description

**Context**: What were you trying to do? What role were you in?

**Details**: Specific technical details, error messages, workflow issues

**Suggested Improvement**: Concrete suggestions for fixing or enhancing

**Impact**: How would this improvement help future agents?

## Current Feedback Log

### Example Entry - 2025-05-25 - ANALYST/SOLO DEV - Python Web App

**Issue/Suggestion**: Git binary path instructions could be clearer

**Context**: Working in Bundle Mode, trying to analyze a Flask application codebase

**Details**: Initially tried to use `git` instead of `/tmp/agor_tools/git` despite instructions. The warnings helped but could be more prominent.

**Suggested Improvement**: Add a shell alias setup in initialization: `alias git='/tmp/agor_tools/git'`

**Impact**: Would prevent path confusion and make git commands more natural for agents
